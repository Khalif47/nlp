This unit is an introduction to the techniques, frameworks and processes comprising 3D modelling and 3D imaging. Foundations of 3D aims to give students an understanding of 3D modelling by developing skills in 3D model creation for a variety of contexts, including 3D prototyping, 3D visualisation and 3D modelling for games and animation. Students will communicate their knowledge of 3D theory through the production of designs that demonstrate geometrical modelling, texture mapping, virtual lighting techniques, camera positioning, and rendering procedures.
